## Basic Task

In this assignment, the goal is to create a ReactJS chat application. The app should have a text box where users can type their messages and a send button to submit the message. When the send button is clicked, the chat message should be displayed above the text box.

Each message should be associated with a randomly assigned username from the provided user list:

```javascript
const user_list = ["Alan", "Bob", "Carol", "Dean", "Elin"];
```

Additionally, each message should include a like button on the right end, which when clicked, increases the like count. The count should be displayed next to the like button.

## Stretch Goals (Optional)

1. Mentions Feature: Add a mentions (@) feature to the chat. When a user types '@', display a list of users from the provided user list for easy tagging and directing messages to specific individuals.
2. Emoji Options: Implement the ability to add emojis in chat messages, allowing users to express themselves with a wide range of emotions.
